    "name": "Cooling Fan",
    "Description": "A computer fan is any fan inside, or attached to, a computer case used for active cooling. Fans are used to draw cooler air into the case from the outside, expel warm air from inside and move air across a heat sink to cool a particular component. Both axial and sometimes centrifugal (blower/squirrel-cage) fans are used in computers. Computer fans commonly come in standard sizes, such as 92 mm, 120 mm (most common), 140 mm, and even 200-220 mm. Computer fans are powered and controlled using 3-pin or 4-pin fan connectors.",
